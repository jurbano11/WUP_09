# Predicting Fish Weight
```{r}
fish <- read.csv(file = "Fish.csv")
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
 
fish <- fish %>%
mutate(across(where(is.character), as.factor))
levels(fish$Species)
Bream <- filter(fish, Species == "Bream")
Bream <- select(Bream, -Species) 
Parkki <- filter(fish, Species == "Parkki")
Parkki <- select(Parkki, -Species) 
Perch <- filter(fish, Species == "Perch")
Perch <- select(Perch, -Species) 
Pike <- filter(fish, Species == "Pike")
Pike <- select(Pike, -Species) 
Roach <- filter(fish, Species == "Roach")
Roach <- select(Roach, -Species) 
Smelt <- filter(fish, Species == "Smelt")

```

# For each of the three species of fish listed below, determine the best regression model and also the best 2 element regression model. Use the BestSubset Regression helper file.


## Perch

### Best Models

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Perch,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="topright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```


### Best Two regressor model

Best 2 regressor models are height and width.

```{r}
Perchmodel <-lm(Weight~Height+Width, data=Perch)
summary.lm(Perchmodel)
```

The adjusted r-square is 0.94 and the residual standard error is 85.17, with a p-value


## Pike

```{r}
library(leaps)
regsubsets.out <-
    regsubsets(Weight ~ .,
               data = Pike,
               nbest = 1,       # 1 best model for each number of predictors
               nvmax = NULL,    # NULL for no limit on number of variables
               force.in = NULL, force.out = NULL,
               method = "exhaustive")

summary.out <- summary(regsubsets.out)
as.data.frame(summary.out$outmat)
library(car)
subsets(regsubsets.out,statistic="adjr2",legend="bottomright",main="Adjusted R^2")
```

L1, L3 are two best regression model. Best regression model is everything



### Best Models
```{r}
Pikebest <-lm(Weight~.,data=Pike)
summary.lm(Pikebest)
```
The adjusted r-squared is 0.9 and the residual standard error is 85.17, with a p-value

### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
Piketwo <-lm(Weight~Length1+Length3, data=Pike)
summary.lm(Piketwo)
```
This model summarizes put best two regression models. The residual standard error is 92.56. The r-squared is 0.09649 and the p-value is 2.572e-11. The smallest p-value has the best result.


### Best Two regressor model

```{r}
Piketwo <-lm(Weight~Length1+Length3, data=Pike)
summary.lm(Piketwo)
```
This model summarizes put best two regression models. The residual standard error is 92.56. The r-squared is 0.09649 and the p-value is 2.572e-11. The smallest p-value has the best result.
